# Objective

Our objective is to observe how policies correlate to an increase or decrease in COVID-19 transmission to determine how useful that policy is in real time and provide some concrete feedback to the government regarding the effectiveness of their policies.

## 3 Policies
### [Enforcement of Mask-Wearing By State](./maskWearing.html)

A list of states that have enacted mask wearing, the date the mask-wearing policy was enacted, and levels of COVID-19 transmission rates before and after the enactment of the mask-wearing policy. (Note: Correlation is not Causation and there are many other factors that we were not able to consider (ie holidays, actual enforcement of policy by retail places, culture, etc.))

### [Stay-at-Home Order](./stayAtHome.html)

A list of states that have enacted stay-at-home orders, the date that the stay-at-home order was enacted, and levels of COVID-19 transmission rates before and after the enactment of the stay-at-home order. (Note: Correlation is not Causation and there are many other factors that we were not able to consider (ie holidays, actual enforcement of policy by retail places, culture, etc.))

### [COVID-19 Stimulus Check](./stimCheck.html)

We compiled the number of cases 2 months before and 2 months after the enactment of the COVID-19 Stimulus Check to see if the distribution of the check had any effect on COVID-19 transmission. (Note: Correlation is not Causation and there are many other factors that we were not able to consider (ie holidays, actual enforcement of policy by retail places, culture, etc.))
