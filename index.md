# Objective

Our objective is to observe how policies correlate to an increase or decrease in COVID-19 transmission to determine how useful that policy is in real time and provide some concrete feedback to the government regarding the effectiveness of their policies.

(Note: Correlation is not causation and there are many other factors that we were not able to consider (ie holidays, actual enforcement of policy by retail places, culture, etc.) There are many other factors that may be present that can cause an increase of COVID-19 transmission. Please contact the CDC for more information regarding COVID-19 cases at [CDC Website](https://www.cdc.gov/library/researchguides/2019novelcoronavirus/websites.html))

## Main Policies
### [Enforcement of Mask-Wearing By State](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1maS6UmTHeOw9ijXwb9JTuqOWdV6z_ClcpDrU1et1P2g/edit#gid=0)

A list of states that have enacted mask wearing including:
 - the date the mask-wearing policy was enacted
 - levels of COVID-19 transmission rates before the enactment of the mask-wearing policy.
 - levels of COVID-19 transmission rates after the enactment of the mask-wearing policy.

### [Stay-at-Home Order](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1maS6UmTHeOw9ijXwb9JTuqOWdV6z_ClcpDrU1et1P2g/edit#gid=0)

A list of states that have enacted stay-at-home orders including:
 - the date that the stay-at-home order was enacted
 - levels of COVID-19 transmission rates before the enactment of the stay-at-home order
 - levels of COVID-19 transmission rates after the enactment of the stay-at-home order

## Ethical Considerations

One major ethical issue with delivering the data of transmission rates without adding in other considerations of culture and actual enforcement of policy is that people can extrapolate certain information that fits their agenda. For example, if a mask-wearing mandate was implemented in a certain state, but COVID-19 transmission rates still continued to grow, that doesn't mean that mask-wearing is ineffective. Rather, we are unable to paint the whole picture, which may include people not enforcing the mask-wearing mandates, the celebration of certain events which means large gatherings may occur, and several other possibilities that are unable to be shown (given the timespan of the competition). As a result, people who don't support mask-wearing may be able to extrapolate from our data that mask-wearing is ineffective, when the reality is, we don't currently have the means to present those factors to the readers. Thus, we try to avoid this ethical concern by providing a disclaimer to all of our readers.

TLDR: We are unable to provide all the possible factors that may cause an increase or decrease in COVID-19 transmission rates and we want our readers to not make decisions without considering all the possible factors. However, hopefully this website will be able to provide some help in regards to data-driven decision making in border communities.
